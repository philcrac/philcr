I spent lots of hours listening to Robert Greene's podcast, somewhere down the rabbit hole I got driven back the nice habit of writing about the cool stuff I learn about software development, testing & cyber security.

I've always been intrigued by fancy gimmicks cyber nerds pull (I'd die to be one), this led me to explore blogs, tools, ctf-labs to get to the thrills of the cyber world.I have been lucky to be led into the CRM world by my mentor Nathan Leverington; who single-handedly paved the way for me into Salesforce. 

Even though born & raised in Kenya,my country's dominance in track athletic events globally has not had me gravitated toward the sport as my bossom is towards soccer;Messi is the best soccer player no debate on that...
